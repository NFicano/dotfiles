## About

This repo contains my dotfiles, the scripts to bootstrap my Mac OS environment, and various utilities that have no other home.

- ``misc`` - stuff that doesn't have a home.
- ``rc.d`` - config files that I symlink to my home directory.

## Installation

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running
