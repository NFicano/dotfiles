# my dotfiles

## Installation

**Warning:** If you want to give these dotfiles a try, you should first fork
this repository, review the code, and remove things you donâ€™t want or need.
Don't blindly use my settings unless you understand them.

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it
  in `~/github/dotfiles`.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest
  version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nficano/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && make install
```
